# Low-Dependency Node.js

A guide for Node.js programmers that want to minimise their dependecies.

## What is is?

"Low Dependency" Node.js is basically a philosophy for putting together solutions using JavaScript and Node.js but with libraries and projects that have as few dependencies as possible. 

You dont have to code everything from scratch, you are allowed to use libraries to get your work done. But every choice of library is done deliberately, reducing the number of downstream dependencies to the absolute minimum. Ideally none.

It is not the same "Vanilla JS", but its the next best thing if you want to remain useful in your work without relying on a zillion libraries and their dependencies.

## Tools of the Trade

- [NPM](https://npmjs.org): Your first port of call for most Node.js packages.
- [Anvaka NPM Dependency Visualiser](https://npm.anvaka.com/): Helps you visualise downstream dependendencies.

## Why?

I tend to do this in all my projects. Given recent NPM scandals its clear that other people could use some help too. So this work will benefit others.
