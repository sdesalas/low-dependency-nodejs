# Low Dependency Node.js

A guide for Node.js programmers that want to minimise their dependecies.

## Why?

Because I need one. There are so many JavaScript projects out there its hard to distinguish between them, and when I'm in doubt i tend to pick the ones with fewer dependencies. 

Given recent NPM scandals its clear that other people could use some help too. So this work will benefit others.
